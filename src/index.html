        <p> This is an experiment to measure your tinnitus </p>
        <p> Before starting, you will need to calibrate the experiment </p>
        <p> You will need to adjust the volume level on your computer to it's maximum </p>
        <p> Don't worry - we won't play sounds that are so loud as to hurt your ears </p>
        <p> After you have done this, push the <strong> Start Button </strong> </p>
<!--         <p> Push the <strong> play </strong> button to play a tone </p>
        <p> Adjust the volume of the tone using the louder and softer buttons. </p>
        <p> Your goal is to find a level for each tone that is fairly soft but comfortable to you. </p>
